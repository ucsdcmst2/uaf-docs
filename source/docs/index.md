Welcome to the High Energy Physics User Analysis Facility at UC San Diego, part of the CMS Tier-2 computing infrastructure. We provide advanced computational resources and expert support for high energy physics research, particularly focused on CMS experiment data analysis. 

## About the CMS T2 Facility

The UCSD CMS T2 center is one of the primary Tier-2 computing facilities in the United States supporting research for the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Our facility offers:

- High-performance computing clusters with modern AMD EPYC processors
- Extensive CEPH distributed storage systems for managing petabyte-scale datasets
- HTCondor batch system for efficient job submission and processing
- Specialized tools for CMS data analysis including CMSSW support
- Integration with global CMS computing resources through Grid infrastructure

## Getting Started

If you're new to the UCSD UAF, please start with our [Requesting an Account](quickstart/requesting_account.md) guide, followed by [Accessing the UAF](quickstart/accessing_uaf.md). 

For returning users, you may want to explore our documentation on [HTCondor](setup/condor.md), [CEPH storage](setup/ceph.md), or [Docker containers](misc/using_docker.md).
